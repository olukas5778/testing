<h3> Here is the branding that I designed through my internship, Running Name LLC for a brand named "Dope Digial". The program provides pro-bono technical services and guidance to small businesses and and non-profits. For this logo, my boss wanted it to be simple and and highlight the theme of digital transformation. I used illustrator to create this logo and utilized and futuristic font. I then created several mockups such as the app or website icon and a mockup of the logo in the website.</h3>

<h3> I designed this logo using Illustrator for Lolita's Kitchen through my internship. The owner wanted an elegant logo utilizing black, gold, and marble. I used gold and chose a font that features a marble design and connected the fork and knife to the letters to demonstrate the idea of a homestyle kitchen. I designed about fifteen different logos and variations for each logo so she could pick and choose her favorite elements from each. This design in particular happened to be my favorite and one I'm most proud of. </h3>

Picuted below is one of the many speaker badges I designed using Illustrator.  </h3>
