      <h3>First project</h3>
      <h3> For my first UX project, I designed the foundations of a coffee shop for users in Harrisonburg. I created this design my sophomore year of college in my first User Design class at JMU. I went through the initial research process by interviewing seven users, building a card sort to measure how the users think about the content, and compiling the data to get the base of a potential app. I then created six design requirements and 2 personas to build a narrative for this <a href="file:///Users/orianalukas/Desktop/bootstrap-template-5.3.0/images/user%20research%20(1).pdf">app. </a> </h3>

      <h3> Java Joint Website </h3>
      <h3> This was my final project for my Interactive Design course I took my junior year. For the assignment we could design a website based off any idea using Sublime and Bootstrap. I chose to design a website for a coffee shop, <a href="https://olukas5778.github.io/Final-Java-joint/index.html"> Java Joint. </a>  I also designed all the accopanying graphics including the logo. The website was then published to Github pages.</h3>

      <h3>Second project</h3>
      <h3> For my second UX project, I worked in a group with two other members to design an app named ConServe that reduced food waste. This was a semester long project that was broken down into several design phases. After brainstorming, we agreed on the problem of food waste and came up with an app that tracks food expiration dates. We went through our first round of interviews to gather data and create an affinity diagram which helped us sort our findings into categories. From there, we started thinking of design requirements and the specifics of our app. We used Figma to design our high-fidelity and low-fidelity models so we could test our users with a realistic version of the app. The final submission included the high-fidelity models, a report, final testing, a video, and a poster. </h3>

<h3> Above is our high-fidelity prototype which serves as a model for how the actual app will look. Below is our final report which is a culmination of everything we have accumulated and designed throughout the semester. This includes an executive summary, interviews, interview findings, affinity diagrams, testingâ€™s, design features, and our protypes. <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFiAGbH4bk/oAgrCW7XyCQYBEBXz-jXQQ/edit?utm_content=DAFiAGbH4bk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton"> Report</a></h3>
